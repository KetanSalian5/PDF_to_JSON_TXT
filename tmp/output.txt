 I would like to take this opportunity to share with you the overall  performance of the Company in 2022-2023.

Page Number: 11
 Despite a challenging macro-economic environment marked by  significant operating and cost headwinds, the Company delivered  a resilient finish to the fiscal year. During the year, the Company  delivered revenue from operations of ₹3918 crore, flat versus year  ago, with a one-time non-operating income and the pandemic- linked demand surge in the healthcare portfolio in the base  period. Operationally sales were up 3% for the fiscal. Further,  the  Company reported Profit After Tax (PAT) of ₹678 crores, up 18%  versus year ago including one-time tax impacts. Excluding these

Page Number: 11
 one-time impacts, Profit After Tax (PAT) is up 10% operationally.

Page Number: 11
 This encouraging growth was driven by premiumization and productivity interventions, as the Company  continued to make sequential progress in profit growth, despite macro-economic challenges, and a muted  growth in the healthcare category in the first three quarters of the year owing to the pandemic linked  demand surge in the base period.

Page Number: 11
 The Company continued to raise the bar on superiority, innovation, and industry-leading practices. The driving  force has been the focused execution of its integrated growth strategy - a focus on daily use categories where  performance drives brand choice, superiority (of product, package, communication, go-to-market execution,  and value), productivity, constructive disruption, and an agile and accountable organization structure and  culture – which enabled a sustainable, balanced growth and value creation.

Page Number: 11
 The feminine care and healthcare brands, Whisper, and Vicks respectively, continue to grow behind a strong  product portfolio, superior consumer communication and a continuous stream of product innovations like  Whisper Hygiene Comfort, Whisper Choice Nights, Vicks ZzzQuil, Vicks Roll-On Inhaler and Vicks Xtra Strong.

Page Number: 11
 Whisper continued its journey of raising awareness regarding menstruation, with the fourth edition of its  long running #KeepGirlsInSchool (KGIS) movement, with the aim of educating mothers on the biology of  periods to help them educate their daughters.

Page Number: 11
 Whisper also continues to scale up the ‘Whisper Menstrual Health & Hygiene Program’, educating over 2  crore girls on puberty and hygiene over last two years. To date, Whisper has educated over 10 crore girls and  mothers. This year, Whisper India also partnered with UNESCO India to introduce teaching-learning modules,  addressing the challenges related to menstrual health and hygiene management, including in relation to  disability, gender, teachers and educators, young adults, and nutrition.

Page Number: 11
 The Company’s flagship CSR program, P&G Shiksha, is a 360-degree educational intervention that addresses  three critical barriers to achieving universal education – access to education infrastructure, gender inequality  in access to education and gap in learning.

Page Number: 11
 As we enter the new fiscal year, the Company is well positioned to sustain and improve its performance with a  resilient and empowered workforce, leverage opportunities with agility, address challenges and overcome the  risks. While short to medium term challenges exist owing to a weak global economic outlook, the long-term  outlook for the FMCG sector remains positive. We will continue to focus on our integrated growth strategy  which has consistently enabled us to deliver sustained and balanced growth.

 ECONOMY AND MARKETS

Page Number: 12
 The operating environment this year continued to be  volatile, marked by macro-economic challenges and

Page Number: 12
 high commodity inflation contributing to significant  cost headwinds. Consumers continued to face  inflationary pressures during the year, leading to  consumer demand remaining tepid. Despite these  headwinds, the Indian economy gained momentum  towards the end of the financial year, achieving a real  GDP growth of 7.2%* in fiscal year 2022-23.

Page Number: 12
 Several initiatives and measures taken by the  Government, including higher Capital Expenditure  (Capex) among others contributed to the economic  growth as it boosted private consumption and  consumer confidence. Further, encouraging growth  in the country’s digital and physical infrastructure,  innovative measures such as PM GatiShakti, the  National Logistics Policy, and the Production-Linked  Incentive schemes to boost manufacturing output,  have also contributed significantly to the economic  growth.

 INTEGRATED STRATEGIC CHOICES

 <image: DeviceCMYK, width: 365, height: 368, bpc: 8>

Page Number: 13
 The Company has delivered strong results over the  years, in a volatile macro environment against very  capable competition, through focus on executing our  integrated strategies with excellence. We are focused  on delighting and serving consumers, customers and  shareholders through five strategic and integrated  choices: a portfolio of  products where performance  drives brand choice; superiority across product,  package, brand communication, retail execution and  value; productivity in everything we do; constructive  disruption across the value chain; and an agile,  accountable and empowered organization. These are  not independent strategic choices. They reinforce  and build on each other, and when executed well,  they lead to balanced top-line and bottom-line  growth and value creation. There is still meaningful  opportunity for improvement and leverage in every  facet of this strategy, and we continue to work to  strengthen our execution of these choices.

 We continue to delight our consumers with strong  innovation  across  the  portfolio.  Whisper  has

Page Number: 13
 continued to ensure superior product performance.  Whisper premium portfolio went through product  innovation- Hygiene + Comfort, which was designed  for better comfort with boosted core and adding soft  wings. The innovation improved not just absorbency  but enhanced comfort which helped us address  the need for soft wings without comprising on the  protection.

Page Number: 13
 The Company also significantly stepped up on the  product performance of the longer length products  – Whisper Choice Ultra XL and Whisper Choice XL.  With these interventions, both products delivered  superior protection, drier feel and better integrity in- use, which enabled us to meet the consumer need  on long lasting protection (vs. earlier product). With  the improved products, both Whisper Choice Ultra  XL and Whisper Choice XL have grown penetration vs  last fiscal year.

However,  the cost of developing  sustainable packaging  alternative and cost  implementing processes  to be put in place for  compliance with EPR  obligations in respect of  reuse, recycle and end  of life disposal of plastic  packaging waste could  be significant.

 1  Brief outline of the Company's CSR policy:

Page Number: 45
 Doing the right thing is the foundation of Procter  & Gamble’s Purpose, Values, and Principles. It is  naturally woven into the way we work every day.  We call this responsibility – Citizenship, and our  Citizenship framework is based on key pillars  of Community Impact, Equality & Inclusion and  Environmental Sustainability, with a strong  foundation of Ethics & Corporate Responsibility  guiding everything we do.

Page Number: 45
 Our Community Impact efforts are brought to life  via our flagship Corporate Social Responsibility  program – P&G Shiksha. The program focuses on  providing education for underprivileged children  through a 360-degree educational intervention.

Page Number: 45
 P&G Shiksha began in 2005 with the intention  of building schools to provide access to  education to underprivileged children. As the  country progressed, P&G Shiksha evolved into  a 360-degree program that aims to enhance  children’s  learning  environment,  improve

Page Number: 45
 learning outcomes, and empower marginalized  communities through education.

Page Number: 45
 Details on programs under P&G Shiksha as are  follows:

Page Number: 45
 Strengthening Educational Infrastructure

Page Number: 45
 Many schools in the remote towns and villages  of the country operate from dilapidated or  open structures. Strong infrastructural support  at schools can help make the environment  around children more conducive to learning and  eliminating distractions. Therefore, together with  our partners at Round Table India, we undertake  educational infrastructure enhancement projects  that include building classrooms and essential  infrastructural enhancement like furniture, black  boards among others. We also focus on building  playgrounds and improving health and hygiene  facilities for children like clean drinking water  and separate toilets for girls and boys at schools.  This helps improve the learning environment for  children and teachers, and the impact is seen  in increasing enrolments, better attendance,  reducing dropouts, driving lesson- efficiency for  teachers, encouraging students, and therefore,  overall higher learning level.

Page Number: 45
 Imparting Early Childhood Education

Page Number: 45
 We implement our Early Childhood Education  program with our partner Pratham Foundation  to enable this holistic development of children  and their readiness for school in the age group of  3-6 years. During the early stages of childhood,  when brain development is at its highest point,  nurturing the appropriate developmental skills  of children has been closely linked with positive  outcomes, including improved school readiness  and increased knowledge retention of the child.  Therefore, through the program, we focus on  developing motor, cognitive, social-emotional,  language and creative skills in children, to help  set them up for a fast-paced growth as they  begin their education journey.

Page Number: 45
 Leveraging Technology To Bridge Learning Gaps

Page Number: 45
 We are partnering with Educational Initiatives to  implement ‘Mindspark’, an artificial intelligence  based adaptive learning tool to remediate  learning gaps in students across government  schools in 6 states of the country. The tool  integrates pedagogy, teacher instruction and  a learning management system to assess a  student’s learning level and develop a customized  learning path for each one of them. The program  has garnered strong support from various state  governments and is poised for successful scaling  and widespread implementation in priority state  schools. This AI enabled tech is truly helping us  enable thousands of children across the country,  in improving their learning outcomes and bringing  their learning levels at par with their grade level.

Page Number: 45
 Remediating Learning Gaps In Communities

Page Number: 45
 We are implementing on-ground remedial learning  interventions  in  partnership with  Pratham

Page Number: 45
 Education Foundation, by using a community  based and an ‘in-school’ model, together with  the support of trained volunteers from within the  community and teachers at school. As part of  this, we are following the approach of ‘Teaching  at the Right Level’, where children in Grades 3 to  5 are grouped according to their learning levels  rather than grade, and level-specific activities are  conducted to help strengthen their skills in these  subjects. With schools reopening completely  post the pandemic, we have concentrated our

 Sr. Key Audit Matter Auditor’s Response

Page Number: 75
 1. Revenue Recognition (note no. 2.3(a) and 20  to the financial statements)

Page Number: 75
 Revenue is measured net of trade discounts,  rebates and various types of Marketing and  Distribution Activities such as incentives  and promotions.

Page Number: 75
 The estimation of the various types of  discounts, incentives and rebate schemes to  be recognised based on sales made during  the year is material and considered to be  judgmental owing to the varying terms of  the agreements with customers which are  based on annual contracts or shorter term  arrangements. In addition, the value and  timing of promotions for products varies  from period to period, and the activity can  span over a year end.

Page Number: 75
 Our audit procedures included:

Page Number: 75
 (a) Assessing  the  appropriateness  of  the  revenue

Page Number: 75
 recognition  accounting  policies,  including those

Page Number: 75
 relating to discounts, incentives and rebates by  comparing with applicable accounting standards.

Page Number: 75
 (b) Testing the design, implementation and operating

Page Number: 75
 effectiveness of the Company’s general IT controls  and key IT/manual application controls over the  Company’s systems which govern recording of revenue  and rebates/schemes in the general ledger accounting  system.

Page Number: 75
 (c) We tested the design, implementation and operating

Page Number: 75
 effectiveness of controls over the calculation of  discounts, incentives and rebates including review of  the independent service auditor’s SOC 1 (Type 2) report  with regards to the third party service organization’s  system and the suitability of the design and operating  effectiveness of IT / manual controls relating to  processing of claims.

Page Number: 76
 Accumulated experience is used to estimate  the provision for discounts and rebates  considering the terms of the underlying  schemes and arrangements with customers.

Page Number: 76
 There is also a risk that revenue may  be overstated due to fraud including  through manipulation of the discounts and  incentives recognised resulting from the  pressure local management may feel to  achieve performance targets.

Page Number: 76
 (d) Performing substantive testing (including year-end

 2. Uncertain Tax Positions (note no. 27 and 36  to the financial statements)

Page Number: 76
 The Company is subject to a range of tax  risks. There is inherent judgement involved  in determining provisions for uncertain  tax positions. The Company is subject to  periodic challenges by local tax authorities  on a range of tax matters during the  normal course of business, including direct  taxes, transfer pricing and indirect taxes.  Applicable tax laws and regulations are  subject to differing interpretations and  the resolution of a final tax position can  take several years to complete. Where the  amount of tax payable is uncertain, the  Company establishes provisions based on  Management’s judgement of the likelihood  of settlement being required.

Page Number: 76
 Given the number of judgements involved  in estimating the provisions relating to  uncertain tax positions and the complexities  of dealing with tax rules, this was considered  as a key audit matter.

Page Number: 76
 Our audit procedures included:

Page Number: 76
 (a) We evaluated the design and tested the operating

Page Number: 76
 effectiveness of controls over the assessment  of uncertain tax positions and completeness of  disclosures.

Page Number: 76
 (b) We discussed the status and potential exposures in

Page Number: 76
 respect of significant tax litigations with the Company’s  tax team including their views on the likely outcome  of each assessment / litigation and magnitude of  potential exposure.

Page Number: 76
 (c) We focused on the judgements made by Management

Page Number: 76
 in assessing the likelihood of potentially material  exposures and the estimates used to determine such  provisions where required. In particular, we focused  on the impact of changes in local tax regulations and  ongoing inspections by local tax authorities, which  could materially impact the amounts recorded in the  financial statements.

Page Number: 76
 (d) We involved our in-house tax experts to evaluate

Page Number: 76
 and challenge the appropriateness of Management's  assessment  and  judgements  to  estimate  the

Page Number: 76
 provisions held in respect of uncertain tax positions.  To do this, we assessed the provisions recognized in  the financial statements using the outcome of prior  and ongoing tax assessments conducted on the  Company, correspondences between the Company  and relevant tax authorities, judgemental positions  taken in tax returns and current year estimates, our  own experience in these areas and assessing whether  the approach applied by the Company is supported by  the practice in the industry.

Page Number: 76
 (e) We have also assessed the adequacy of the Company's

Page Number: 76
 disclosures in respect of tax and uncertain tax  positions.

 Information Other than the Ind-AS Financial  Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon

Page Number: 77
 The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible  for the other information. The other information  comprises the Director’s Report and Report on  Corporate Governance but does not include the  financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Page Number: 77
 Our opinion on the financial statements does not  cover the other information and we do not express  any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Page Number: 77
 In connection with our audit of the financial  statements, our responsibility is to read the other  information identified above and, in doing so,  consider whether the other information is materially  inconsistent with the financial statements or our  knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears  to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we  have performed on the other information that we  obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we  conclude that there is a material misstatement of  this other information, we are required to report that  fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

 Management’s Responsibilities for the Financial  Statements

Page Number: 77
 The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible  for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act  with respect to the preparation of these financial  statements that give a true and fair view of the  financial position, financial performance, changes in  equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance  with the accounting principles generally accepted in  India, including the Accounting Standards specified  under Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility  also includes maintenance of adequate accounting  records in accordance with the provisions of the  Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company  and for preventing and detecting frauds and  other irregularities; selection and application of  appropriate accounting policies; making judgments  and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;  and design, implementation and maintenance of  adequate internal financial controls, that were  operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and  completeness of the accounting records, relevant  to the preparation and presentation of the financial  statements that give a true and fair view and are free  from material misstatement, whether due to fraud  or error.

Page Number: 77
 In preparing the financial statements, Management  is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to  continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,  matters related to going concern and using the going  concern basis of accounting unless Management  either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease

Page Number: 77
 operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do  so.

Page Number: 77
 The Board of Directors is also responsible for  overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

Page Number: 77
 Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the  Financial Statements

Page Number: 77
 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance  about whether the financial statements as a whole  are free from material misstatement, whether due  to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report  that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance  is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee  that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs  will always detect a material misstatement when it  exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error  and are considered material if, individually or in the  aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to  influence the economic decisions of users taken on  the basis of these financial statements.

Page Number: 77
 As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise  professional judgment and maintain professional  skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

Page Number: 77
 •   Identify and assess the risks of material  misstatement of the financial statements,  whether due to fraud or error, design and  perform audit procedures responsive to those  risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient  and appropriate to provide a basis for our  opinion. The risk of not detecting a material  misstatement resulting from fraud is higher  than for one resulting from error, as fraud may  involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,  misrepresentations, or the override of internal  control.

Page Number: 77
 •   Obtain an understanding of internal control  relevant to the audit in order to design  audit procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) the  Act, we are also responsible for expressing our  opinion on whether the company has adequate  internal financial controls system in place and  the operating effectiveness of such controls.

Page Number: 77
 •   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting  policies  used  and the  reasonableness  of

Page Number: 77
 accounting estimates and related disclosures  made by Management.

Page Number: 77
 •   Conclude  on  the  appropriateness  of

Page Number: 77
 Management’s use of the going concern basis  of accounting and, based on the audit evidence  obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists  related to events or conditions that may cast  significant doubt on the Company’s ability to  continue as a going concern. If we conclude that  a material uncertainty exists, we are required

 to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the  related disclosures in the financial statements or,  if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our  opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit  evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s  report. However, future events or conditions may  cause the Company to cease to continue as a  going concern.

Page Number: 78
 •   Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and  content of the financial statements, including the  disclosures, and whether the financial statements  represent the underlying transactions and events  in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Page Number: 78
 Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the  financial statements that, individually or in aggregate,  makes it probable that the economic decisions of the  users of the financial statements may be influenced.  We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative  factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work  and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to  evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements  in the financial statements.

Page Number: 78
 We communicate with those charged with governance  regarding, among other matters, the planned scope  and timing of the audit and significant audit findings,  including any significant deficiencies in internal  control that we identify during our audit.

Page Number: 78
 We also provide those charged with governance with  a statement that we have complied with relevant  ethical requirements regarding independence, and to  communicate with them all relationships and other  matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on  our independence, and where applicable, related  safeguards.

Page Number: 78
 From the matters communicated with those charged  with governance, we determine those matters that  were of most significance in the audit of the financial  statements of the current period and are therefore  the key audit matters. We describe these matters  in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation  precludes public disclosure about the matter or  when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine  that a matter should not be communicated in our  report because the adverse consequences of doing  so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the  public interest benefits of such communication.

 program for physical verification of Property,  Plant and Equipment and lease assets  (including non-current assets held for sale)  at periodic intervals by which all Property,  Plant and Equipment are verified in a  phased manner over a period of three years.  In our opinion, the period of verification is  reasonable having regard to the size of the  Company and the nature of its Property, Plant  and Equipment. The discrepancies reported  on such verification are not material and  have been properly dealt with in the books  of account.

Page Number: 80

Page Number: 81

Page Number: 84
 Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain  audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal  financial controls system with reference to financial  statements and their operating effectiveness. Our  audit of internal financial controls with reference  to financial statements included obtaining an  understanding of internal financial controls with  reference to financial statements, assessing the  risk that a material weakness exists and testing and  evaluating the design and operating effectiveness  of internal control based on the assessed risk.  The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s  judgment, including the assessment of the risks of  material misstatement of the financial statements,  whether due to fraud or error.

Page Number: 84
 We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained  is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis  for our audit opinion on the Company’s internal  financial controls system with reference to financial  statements.

 Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference  to Financial Statements

Page Number: 84
 A Company's internal financial control with reference  to financial statements is a process designed to  provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability  of financial reporting and the preparation of financial  statements for external purposes in accordance  with generally accepted accounting principles. A  company's internal financial control with reference  to financial statements includes those policies and  procedures that:

Page Number: 84
 1)  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in  reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect  the transactions and dispositions of the assets  of the company;

Page Number: 84
 2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions

Page Number: 84
 are recorded as necessary to permit preparation  of financial statements in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles and  that receipts and expenditures of the company

 Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls  with reference to Financial Statements

Page Number: 85
 Because of the inherent limitations of internal  financial  controls with  reference to financial

Page Number: 85
 statements, including the possibility of collusion or  improper management override of controls, material  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and  not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation  of the internal financial controls with reference to  financial statements to future periods are subject  to the risk that the internal financial control with  reference to financial statements may become  inadequate because of changes in conditions, or  that the degree of compliance with the policies or  procedures may deteriorate.

Page Number: 85

Page Number: 91
 2  Significant accounting policies

Page Number: 91
 2.1 Statement of compliance

Page Number: 91
 The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting  Standards (Ind AS) as notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs pursuant to Section 133 of the  Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act") read with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)  Rules, 2015 as amended from time to time and other relevant provisions of the Act.

Page Number: 91
 2.2 Basis of preparation and measurement

Page Number: 91
 The financial statements have been prepared on accrual and going concern basis. The accounting  policies are applied consistently to all the periods presented in the financial statements. All assets and  liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the Company’s normal operating cycle  and other criteria as set out in the Division II of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013. Based on  the nature of products and the time between acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation  in cash and cash equivalents, the Company has ascertained its operating cycle as 12 months for the  purpose of current or non-current classification of assets and liabilities.

Page Number: 91
 The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain items  that are measured at fair values at the end of the reporting period, as explained in accounting policies  below.

Page Number: 91
 Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and  services.

Page Number: 91
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly  transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price  is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of  an asset or a liability, the Company takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if  market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability  at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these financial  statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-based payment transactions that are within  the scope of Ind AS 102, leasing transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 17, and measurement  that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable value in Ind AS 2.

Page Number: 91
 In addition, for the financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1,  2, or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the  significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows:

Page Number: 91
 Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the  entity can access at the measurement date;

Page Number: 91
 Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within level 1, that are observable for asset  or liability, either directly or indirectly; and

Page Number: 91
 Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

 2.3� Summary�of�Significant�accounting�policies

Page Number: 92
 a.  Revenue recognition

Page Number: 92
 Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to  the Company and the revenue can be reliably  measured, regardless of when the payment is  being made. Revenue is measured on the basis of contracted price, after deduction of any trade  discounts, volume rebates and any taxes or duties collected on behalf of the Government such as  Goods and Services Tax, etc. The Company has concluded that it is the principal in all of its revenue   arrangements since it is the primary obligor in all the revenue arrangements as it has pricing  latitude and is also exposed to inventory and credit risks. Revenue is reduced for rebates and other  similar allowances. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and accrue for the discounts and  rebates considering the terms of the underlying schemes and arrangements with customers.

Page Number: 92
 The specific recognition criteria described below must also be met before revenue is recognised.

Page Number: 92
 Sale of goods

Page Number: 92
 Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the goods are delivered and titles have passed  and there are no longer unfulfilled obligations, at which time all the following conditions are  satisfied:

Page Number: 92
 a.  the Company has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the  goods;

Page Number: 92
 b. the Company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually

Page Number: 92
 associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold;

Page Number: 92
 c.  the amount of revenue can be measured reliably at contract price, after deduction of any trade  discounts, volume rebates and any taxes or duties collected on behalf of the government  such as Goods and Services Tax (GST), etc. Accumulated experience is used to estimate the  provision for such discounts and rebates;

Page Number: 92
 d. it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the

Page Number: 92
 Company; and

Page Number: 92
 e.  the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.

Page Number: 92
 Interest income

Page Number: 92
 Interest income is recorded using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR). Interest income is included in  Other Income in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

Page Number: 92
 b.  Leasing

Page Number: 92
 The Company as a lessee

Page Number: 92
 The Company’s lease assets classes primarily consist of leases for land, buildings and equipments.  The Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract  is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for  a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to  control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether:

Page Number: 92
 (i) The contract involves the use of an identified asset

Page Number: 92
 (ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the

Page Number: 92
 period of the lease and

Page Number: 92
 (iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.

Page Number: 92
 At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”)  and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for  leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these  short-term and low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating  expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

 Annual Report 2022-23

Page Number: 93
 Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end  of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably  certain that they will be exercised.

Page Number: 93
 The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the  lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the  lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at  cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Page Number: 93
 Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over  the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. Right of use assets are  evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their  carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable  amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an  individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent  of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash  Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.

Page Number: 93
 The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease  payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not  readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of these  leases. Lease liabilities are re-measured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right  of use asset if the Company changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a  termination option.

Page Number: 93
 Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease  payments have been classified as financing cash flows.

Page Number: 93
 c.  Foreign currencies

Page Number: 93
 The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (` in lakhs), which is also the Company's  functional currency.

Page Number: 93
 Transaction and balances

Page Number: 93
 Transactions in currencies other than the Company's functional currency i.e. (foreign currencies)  are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end  of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at  the rates prevailing at the Balance Sheet date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are  denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair  value is determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign  currency are not retranslated.

Page Number: 93
 Exchange differences on such translations are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in  the period which they arise.

Page Number: 93
 d. Borrowing costs

Page Number: 93
 Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying  assets, which are assets that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its  intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are  substantially ready for their intended use or sale.

Page Number: 93
 All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which  they are incurred.

Page Number: 93
 e.� Employee�benefits

Page Number: 93
 (i) Short term employee benefits - Short term employee benefits including salaries and

Page Number: 93
 performance incentives, are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss on an undiscounted,  accrual basis during the period of employment.

Page Number: 94
 Liability for the above defined benefit plans is provided on the basis of valuation, as at  the Balance Sheet date, carried out by independent actuary. The actuarial method used  for measuring the liability is the Projected Unit Credit method. The classification of the  Company’s net obligation into current and non-current is as per the actuarial valuation  report.

Page Number: 94
 Remeasurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling,  excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability and the  return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined  benefit liability), are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding  debit or credit to Retained Earnings through Other Comprehensive Income in the period  in which they occur. Remeasurements are not reclassified to the Statement of Profit and  Loss in subsequent periods.

Page Number: 94
 Past service costs are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss on the earlier of:

Page Number: 94
 ▶  The date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and

Page Number: 94
 ▶  The date that the Company recognises related restructuring costs

Page Number: 94
 Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the year  to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The Company recognises the following  changes in the net defined benefit obligation as an expense in the Statement of Profit  and Loss:

 f.  Share-based payment arrangements

Page Number: 95
 Employees (including senior executives) of the Company receive remuneration in the form of share- based payments, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity instruments (equity- settled transactions).

Page Number: 95
 Equity-settled transactions

Page Number: 95
 The Procter and Gamble Company, USA has an "Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP)" whereby the  specified employees covered by the plan are granted an option to purchase shares of the Ultimate  Holding Company i.e. - The Procter and Gamble Company, USA at a fixed price (grant price) for a fixed  period of time. The difference between the market price and grant price on the exercise of the stock  options issued by the Ultimate Holding Company to the employees of the Company is charged in the  year of exercise by the employees. Parent Company will recharge an amount equal to spread as on date  of exercise of options.

Page Number: 95
 The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised in employee benefits expense, together with a  corresponding increase in equity (other reserves) over the period in which the service and performance  conditions are fulfilled (the vesting period). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled  transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting  period has expired and the Company’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will  ultimately vest. Recharge to parent company to the extent of fair value of options will be debited in  equity reserves and any excess recharge above the fair value of options will be recognised as equity  distribution from the Company.

Page Number: 95
 Employee share purchase plan

Page Number: 95
 The Procter and Gamble Company, USA has an “International Stock Ownership Plan (ISOP)” (employee  share purchase plan) whereby specified employees of its subsidiaries have been given a right to purchase  shares of the Ultimate Holding Company i.e. The Procter and Gamble Company, USA. Every employee  who opts for the scheme contributes by way of payroll deduction up to a specified percentage (upto  15%) of base salary towards purchase of shares on a monthly basis. The Company contributes 50%  of employee’s contribution (restricted to 2.5% of his base salary) and charged to employee benefits  expense. The expenses related ISOP are recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss  statement since there are no vesting conditions attached to the scheme.

Page Number: 95
 The expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss for a period represents the movement in cumulative  expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.

Page Number: 95
 When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the  expense had the terms had not been modified, if the original terms of the award are met. An additional  expense is recognised for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment  transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee  as measured at the date of modification. Where  an award is cancelled  by the entity or by the counterparty, any remaining  element of the fair value of  the award is expensed immediately through the Statement of Profit and Loss.

Page Number: 95
 g.  Taxation

Page Number: 95
 Income tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and deferred tax.

Page Number: 95
 Current tax

Page Number: 95
 Provision for current tax for the Company's financial year ended on June 30 is based on the results of  the period July 1 to March 31 (later part of the fiscal year ended March 31) and for the balance and for  the period April 1 to June 30 (beginning of the next fiscal year)  as per the provisions of the Income Tax  Act, 1961 and other applicable tax laws. Taxable profit differs from 'profit before tax' as reported in the  Statement of Profit and Loss because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in  other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The Company's current tax is calculated  using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

 Deferred tax

Page Number: 96
 Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and  liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of  taxable profits. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences.  Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that  it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which those deductible temporary differences  can be utilised.

Page Number: 96
 The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the  extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of  the asset to be recovered.

Page Number: 96
 Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the  period in which the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that  have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

Page Number: 96
 The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would  follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover  or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

Page Number: 96
 Current and deferred tax for the year

Page Number: 96
 Current and deferred tax are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss, except when they relate  to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the  current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity  respectively.

Page Number: 96
 Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set  off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle the asset and the liability on a net basis.  Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to  set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities; and the deferred tax assets and the deferred  tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.

Page Number: 96
 h. Property, plant and equipment

Page Number: 96
 Property, plant and equipment held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or  for administrative purposes, are stated in the balance sheet at acquisition cost less accumulated  depreciation and accumulated impairment losses,if any. Freehold land is not depreciated. Subsequent  costs are included in the assets' carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate,  only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the  Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

Page Number: 96
 Properties in the course of construction for production, supply or administrative purposes are carried  at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees and, for qualifying assets,  borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the Company's accounting policy. Such properties are  classified to the appropriate categories of property, plant and equipment when completed and ready  for intended use. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences  when the assets are ready for their intended use.

Page Number: 96
 Cost of Property, plant and equipment which are not ready for intended use, as on the Balance Sheet  date, is shown as capital work in progress. All other repairs and maintenance cost are charged to the  Statement of Profit and Loss during the period in which they are incurred.

Page Number: 96
 Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets (other than freehold land) less their  residual values over their useful life, using straight-line method. The estimated useful lives and residual  values are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate  accounted for on a prospective basis.

Page Number: 96
 The management's estimate of useful lives are in accordance with Schedule II to the Companies Act,  2013 other than certain assets which are based on Company's expected usage pattern supported by  technical assessment.

 The residual values of the Company fixed assets are assumed to be equal to zero on the premise that  the assets are used  for  their entire productive life, and have no value, on the secondary market or  elsewhere, at the end of the life.

Page Number: 97
 An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic  benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the  disposal or retirement of an item if property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference  between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the Statement  of Profit and Loss.

Page Number: 97
 i.  Impairment of property, plant and equipment

Page Number: 97
 At the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets  to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If  any such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated in order to determine the extent of the  impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual  asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset  belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets  are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest  group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent basis can be identified.

Page Number: 97
 Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value  in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount  rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the  asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

Page Number: 97
 If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its own  carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable  amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

Page Number: 97
 When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating  unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying  amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment  loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal is recognised  immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

Page Number: 97
 j.   Inventories

Page Number: 97
 Inventories consist of raw and packing materials, stores and spares, work in progress, stock-in-trade  and finished goods. Inventories are valued at lower of cost and net realisable value after providing  for obsolescence and other losses where considered necessary. Cost of Inventories is determined on  weighted average basis. Cost of manufactured finished goods and work-in-progress includes material  cost determined on weighted average basis and also includes an appropriate portion of allocable  overheads.

Page Number: 97
 Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated  costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

 k.  Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets

Page Number: 98
 Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a  result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be  required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  When the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance  contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is  virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the Statement of Profit and Loss  net of any reimbursement. Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required  to settle the present obligation at the Balance Sheet date.

Page Number: 98
 If the effect of the time value of money is material,  provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax  rate that reflects its present value, that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of  money and the risks specific to the liability. When discounting  is used, the increase in the provision  due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

Page Number: 98
 Contingent liabilities are disclosed in the Notes to the Financial Statements. Contingent liabilities are  disclosed for (i) possible obligations which will be confirmed only by future events not wholly within  the control of the Company or (ii) present obligations arising from past events where it is not probable  that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the  amount of the obligation cannot be made.

Page Number: 98
 The Company has ongoing disputes with Income Tax Authorities on various matters which are pending  before appellate authorities. In this regard, the management evaluates whether it has any uncertain tax  position requiring adjustments to provision for Income tax. Depending on probability of success in the  matter before the Appellate Authorities, a provision is created or a Contingent liability is disclosed.

Page Number: 98
 Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements as this may result in the recognition  of income that may never be there.

Page Number: 98
 l.  Financial instruments

Page Number: 98
 Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the  contractual provisions of the instrument.

Page Number: 98
 Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are  directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset and financial liabilities (other than  financial asset and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted  from the fair value of the financial asset or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.  Transactions costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial asset and financial liabilities at  fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

Page Number: 98
 m. Financial assets

Page Number: 98
 All regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date  basis. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of  assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place.

Page Number: 98
 All recognised financial assets (except trade receivables) are subsequently measured at either amortised  cost or fair value through profit or loss or fair value through other comprehensive income, depending  on the classification of the financial assets. Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their  recognition, except during the period the Company changes its business model for managing financial  assets.

Page Number: 98

 b) The contractual terms of the instrument give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely

Page Number: 99
 payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

Page Number: 99
 Debt instruments that does not meet the above conditions are subsequently measured at fair value.  Financial assets that are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both, selling  financial assets and collecting contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest,  are subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Fair value movements  are recognized in the other comprehensive income (OCI). A financial asset not classified as either  amortised cost or Fair Value through OCI, is classified as Fair Value through Profit or loss.

Page Number: 99
 Effective�interest�method

Page Number: 99
 The effective interest is a method calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating  interest income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts  estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the debt instrument, or, where appropriate,  a shorter period, to the net carrying amount in initial recognition.

Page Number: 99
 Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for debt instruments. Interest income is recognised  in Statement of Profit and Loss and is included in the "Other income" line item.

Page Number: 99
 Impairment�of�financial�assets

Page Number: 99
 The Company applies expected credit loss model for recognising impairment loss on financial assets  measured at amortised cost, trade receivables and other contractual rights to receive cash or other  financial asset.

Page Number: 99
 Expected credit losses are the weighted average of credit losses with the respective risks of default  occurring as the weights. Credit loss is the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due  to the Company in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Company expects to  receive (i.e. all cash shortfalls), discounted at the original effective interest rate (or credit-adjusted  effective interest rate for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets). The Company  estimates cash flows by considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example,  prepayment, extension, call and similar options) through the expected life of that financial instrument.

Page Number: 99
 The Company measures the loss allowance for a financial instrument at an amount equal to the lifetime  expected credit losses if the credit risk on that financial instrument has increased significantly since  initial recognition. If the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial  recognition, the Company measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount  equal to 12-month expected credit losses. 12-month expected credit losses are portion of the life-time  expected credit losses and represent the lifetime cash shortfalls that will result if default occurs within  the 12 months after the reporting date and thus, are not cash shortfalls that are predicted over the next  12 months.

Page Number: 99
 For trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash, the Company always measures the loss  allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses.

Page Number: 99
 Further, for the purpose of measuring lifetime expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables,  the Company has used a practical expedient as permitted under Ind AS 109. This expected credit loss  allowance is computed based on a provision matrix which takes into account historical credit loss  experience with adjusted for forward-looking information.

Page Number: 99
 Derecognition�of�financial�assets

Page Number: 99
 The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the  asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of  ownership of the asset to another party. If the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all  of the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Company  recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay.  If the Company retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial  asset, the Company continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised  borrowing for the proceeds received.

 On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the asset's carrying amount  and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had  been recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity is recognised in profit or  loss if such gain or loss would have otherwise been recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss on  disposal of that financial asset.

Page Number: 100
 On derecognition of a financial asset other than in its entirety, the Company allocates the previous  carrying amount of the financial asset between the part it continues to recognise under continuing  involvement, and the part it no longer recognises on the basis of the relative fair values of those parts  on the date of the transfer. The difference between the carrying amount allocated to the part that is  no longer recognised and the sum of the consideration received for the part no longer recognised and  any cumulative gain or loss allocated to it that had been recognised in other comprehensive income  is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss on disposal of that financial asset. A cumulative gain  or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is allocated between the part that  continues to be recognised and the part that is no longer recognised on the basis of the relative fair  values of those parts.

Page Number: 100
 Equity instruments

Page Number: 100
 An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after  deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company is recognised at the proceeds  received, net of direct issue costs.

Page Number: 100
 Repurchase of the Company's own equity instruments is recognised and deducted directly in equity. No  gain or loss is recognised in Statement of  Profit and Loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation  of the Company's own equity instruments.

Page Number: 100
 Financial liabilities

Page Number: 100
 All financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Page Number: 100
 Financial liabilities at initial recognition are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit  or loss, loans, borrowings and trade payables, as appropriate.

Page Number: 100
 Financial liabilities that are not held-for-trading and are not designated as at fair value through profit  or loss are measured at amortised cost at the end of the subsequent accounting period. The carrying  amount of financial liabilities that are subsequently measured at amortised cost are determined based  on the effective interest method. Interest expense that is not capitalised as part of costs of an asset  is included in the "Finance costs" in the Statement of Profit and loss.

Page Number: 100
 The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability  and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that  exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability,  or, (where appropriate), a shorter period, to the net carrying amount at initial recognition.

Page Number: 100
 Foreign exchange gains and losses

Page Number: 100
 For financial liabilities that are denominated in a foreign currency and are measured at amortised cost  at the end of each reporting period, the foreign exchange gains and losses are determined based on  the amortised cost of the instrument and are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss.

 Derecognition

Page Number: 101
 The Company derecognises a financial liability when, and only when, the Company's obligations are  discharged, cancelled or have expired. An exchange with a lender of debt instruments with substantially  different terms is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the  recognition of a new liability. Similarly, a substantial modification of the terms of an existing financial  liability is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a  new liability. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the  consideration paid and payable is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss.

 o.  Segment Reporting

Page Number: 101
 Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to  the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) of the Company. The CODM is responsible for allocating  resources and assessing performance of the operating segments of the Company.

 p.  Cash and Cash Equivalents

Page Number: 101

Page Number: 101
 q. Earnings Per Share

Page Number: 101
 Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit for the year after tax attributable to  the equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding  during the period. The weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period and  for all periods presented is adjusted for events, such as bonus shares, other than the conversion  of potential equity shares that have changed the number of equity shares outstanding, without a  corresponding change in resources.

Page Number: 101
 For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit for the year attributable to  equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period is  adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.

Page Number: 101
 r.  Claims

Page Number: 101
 Claims against the Company not acknowledged as debts are disclosed after a careful evaluation of the  facts and legal aspects of the matter involved.

 s.  Assets held for sale

Page Number: 101
 Non-current assets or disposal groups comprising of assets and liabilities are classified as ‘held for  sale’ if it is highly probable that they will be recovered primarily through sales rather than through  continuing use. Subsequently, such non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for  sale are measured at lower of its carrying value and fair value less costs to sell. Losses on initial  classification as held for sale and subsequent gains and losses on re-measurement are recognised in  profit and loss. Non-current assets held for sale are not depreciated or amortised.

 3   Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty

Page Number: 102
 3.1 Critical judgments in applying accounting policies

Page Number: 102
 In the application of the Company's accounting policies, which are described in Note 2, the directors of  the Company are required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts  of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated  assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Page Number: 102
 The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting  estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that  period, or in the period of the revision and future periods of the revision if it affects both current and  future periods.

Page Number: 102
 3.2 Key sources of estimation uncertainty

Page Number: 102
 The following are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation  uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that may have a significant risk of causing a material  adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.

Page Number: 102
 a.  Useful lives of property, plant and equipment

Page Number: 102
 As described at 2.3 (h) above, the Company reviews the estimated useful lives and residual values  of property, plant and equipment at the end of each reporting period.

Page Number: 102
 b.  Fair value measurements and valuation processes

Page Number: 102
 Some of the Company's assets and liabilities are measured at fair value for financial reporting  purposes. The Management of the Company determines the appropriate valuation techniques and  inputs for fair value measurements.

Page Number: 102
 In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company uses market-observable data  to the extent it is available. Where level 1 inputs are not available, the Company engages third  party qualified valuers to perform the valuation. The Management works closely with the qualified  external valuers to establish the appropriate valuation techniques and inputs to the model.

Page Number: 102
 Information about the valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of various  assets and liabilities is disclosed in Note 31.

Page Number: 102
 c.� Defined�benefit�obligation

Page Number: 102
 The costs of providing pensions and other post-employment benefits are charged to the Statement  of Profit and Loss in accordance with Ind AS 19 ‘Employee benefits’ over the period during which  benefit is derived from the employees’ services. The costs are assessed on the basis of assumptions  selected by the Management. These assumptions include salary escalation rate, discount rates,  expected rate of return on assets and mortality rates. The same is disclosed in Note 24, ‘Employee  benefits expense’.

Page Number: 102
 d. Income taxes

Page Number: 102
 The Company’s tax jurisdiction is India. Significant judgments are involved in estimating budgeted  profits for the purpose of paying advance tax, determining the provision for income taxes, including  amount expected to be paid / recovered for uncertain tax positions (refer note 27).

Page Number: 102
 e. Measurement and likelihood of occurrence of provisions and contingencies – As disclosed in Note

Page Number: 102
 15 and Note 36, Management has estimated and measured the likelihood of the litigations and  accounted the provision and contingencies as appropriate.

Page Number: 123
 The Company sponsors funded defined benefit gratuity plan for all eligible employees of the Company.

The level of benefits provided depends on the member’s  length of service, designation and salary at retirement age. The gratuity plan is administered by a  separate trust that is legally separated from the Company. The board of the trust is composed of  representatives from both employer and employees. The board of the trust is required by law and by its  articles of association to act in the interest of the trust and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme,  i.e. active employees, inactive employees, retirees, employer. The board of the trust is responsible for  the investment policy with regard to the assets of the trust.

Page Number: 124
 The employees are entitled to accumulate leave subject to certain limits for future encashment /  availment. The Company makes provision for compensated absences based on an actuarial valuation  carried out at the end of the year.

Page Number: 124
 These plans typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as: Investment risk, interest rate risk,  longevity risk and salary risk.

Page Number: 124
 Investment risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a  discount rate which is determined by reference to market yields at the end of  the reporting period on government bonds.

Page Number: 124
 Interest risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this  will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the plan investments.

Page Number: 124
 Longevity risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference  to the best estimate of the mortality rate of plan participants both during and  after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants  will increase the plans liability.

Page Number: 124
 Salary risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference  to the future salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase on the salary of  plan participants will increase the plans liability.

Page Number: 124
 In respect of the plans, the most recent actuarial valuation of the plan assets and the present value of  the defined benefit obligation were carried out as at June 30, 2023. The present value of the defined  benefit obligation, and the related current service cost and past service cost, were measured using the  projected unit credit method.

 Significant actuarial assumptions of the determination of the defined obligation are discount rate,  expected salary increase and mortality. The sensitivity analyses below have been determined  based on reasonable possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the  reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.

Page Number: 128
 Gratuity Plan (Funded)

Page Number: 128
 If the discount rate is 50 basis points higher (lower), the defined benefit obligation would decrease  by ` 445 lakhs (increase by ` 480 lakhs) (as at June 30, 2022: decrease by ` 362 lakhs (increase by  ` 391 lakhs)).

Page Number: 128
 If the expected salary growth increases (decreases) by 0.5%, the defined benefit obligation would  increase by ` 458 lakhs (decrease by ` 431 lakhs) (as at June 30, 2022: increase by ` 370 lakhs  (decrease by ` 348 lakhs)).

Page Number: 128
 Compensated absence plan (Unfunded)

Page Number: 128
 If the discount rate is 50 basis points higher (lower), the other benefit obligation would decrease  by ` 30 lakhs (increase by ` 33 lakhs) (as at June 30, 2022: decrease by ` 24 lakhs (increase by  ` 26 lakhs)).

Page Number: 128
 If the expected salary growth increases (decreases) by 0.5%, the other benefit obligation would  increase by ` 32 lakhs (decrease by ` 30 lakhs) (as at June 30, 2022: increase by ` 25 lakhs  (decrease by ` 23 lakhs)).

Page Number: 128
 Post retirement medical benefit (PRMB)

Page Number: 128
 If the discount rate is 50 basis points higher (lower), the defined benefit obligation would decrease  by ` 14 lakhs (increase by ` 15 lakhs) (as at June 30, 2022: decrease by ` 18 lakhs (increase by   ` 19 lakhs)).

Page Number: 128
 If the expected medical inflation rate increases (decreases) by 0.5%, the defined benefit obligation  would increase by ` 13 lakhs (decrease by ` 12 lakhs) (as at June 30, 2022: increase by ` 16 lakhs  (decrease by ` 15 lakhs)).

Page Number: 128
 If the expected life expectancy increases (decreases) by 1 year, the defined benefit obligation would  increase by ` 10 lakhs (decrease by ` 10 lakhs) (as at June 30, 2022: increase by ` 12 lakhs (decrease  by ` 12 lakhs)).

Page Number: 128
 The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change of the  defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation  of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.

Page Number: 128
 Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit  obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method as the end of the reporting  period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability  recognised in the Balance Sheet.

Page Number: 128
 There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis  from prior years.

Since the Company does not have interest bearing borrowings,  it is not exposed to risk of changes in market interest rates. The Company has not used any interest rate  derivatives.

Page Number: 130
 31.7 Other price risk management

Page Number: 130
