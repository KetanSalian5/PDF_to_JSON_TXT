 Sharing an equitable and sustainable  digital future

Page Number: 3
 At Infosys, we advocate for the digital path –the digital path to  sustainable and inclusive growth. We’ve always believed that there  is no need for sustainability and productivity to be at odds when it  comes to implementing the Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies  ubiquitously and creating a digital future.

Page Number: 3
 However, we are also keenly aware that the many conveniences ushered in  by our digital embrace are not always equitable or sustainable. While the  pandemic did accelerate all-round digital adoption, not all of us benefited.  The crisis held a mirror to a long-standing issue: billions of people remain  without the universal human right of internet access. And several million  others lack the skills to build a life for themselves – when the way we work,  learn and live is disrupted by digital. The environmental implications of  this growing digitalization is not lost on us either.

Page Number: 3
 The ESG Vision 2030 that we published in 2020, continues to serve as our  roadmap to navigate forward. Join us as we review the progress we’ve  made in fiscal 2022 in this ESG Report. Your constructive feedback and  support means the world to us.

 Dear stakeholder, We take immense pride in the industry-leading  growth and seamless deliveries we orchestrated  to meet our commitments to clients. At the  same time, as COVID-19 becomes endemic in  most of the world, our focus is clearly on more  sustainable and inclusive growth.

 Our One Infosys approach which brings all our capabilities and  all our employees to help us drive our clients’ aspirations and  goals, also – perhaps more significantly – brings the prowess of  those same digital strengths to make a difference to the broader  community. Our business needs to serve the interests of multiple  stakeholder groups to produce the outcomes we seek, and our  shareholders’ support has only strengthened our resolve.

Page Number: 8

Page Number: 8
 Since publishing the Infosys ESG Vision for 2030, we have  relentlessly pursued the aspirations we articulated therein within  a framework of tangible metrics, actionable plans and a clear  roadmap. This has helped us make holistic progress across all  our focus areas including climate change, technology for good,  diversity, equity and inclusion, ethics and transparency, data  privacy and information management.

 We cannot pivot to change everything around us for the better  overnight, but we can integrate purpose across the organization  and lead from the front to deliver on our purpose. As supply  chain constraints continue to plague some sectors and some  parts of our world, as consumers and businesses tackle rising  inflation, our aspiration is to do more to help them navigate the  path forward to create the future that we might all look forward  to. And we know that future is digital. We are fully committed  to drive purposeful activity, to realize it for ourselves and all our  stakeholders.

 The new world of work

Page Number: 9
 The world of work has changed forever.  The pandemic has ensured that. How do  you facilitate employees to improve their  effectiveness while enhancing social connect,  collaboration and innovation and maintaining  the organization’s culture and values? The  Infosys Hybrid working model does just that.  The model focuses on the 3 elements of Work,  Workplace and Workforce.

Page Number: 9
 The hybrid model also helps in building the necessary  resilience by toggling seamlessly between different work  models, depending on the situation, while ensuring efficiency  and new-normal business continuity scenarios. The Infosys  hybrid work model brings the best of old and new to enable a  resilient enterprise.

Page Number: 9
 In the workspace management of the hybrid design, all locations  are enabled with a hoteling application for dynamic space  management. The application enables end users' on-demand  workspace access for individuals and sprint teams. It also  ensures that the competitor client teams are not sitting in  adjacent spaces while providing seamless enablement for client  connectivity using the connectivity portal in just a few clicks.

 Workplace transformation The implementation of a future-ready physical  workspace design to enable an office space  for more collaboration is another important  design consideration of the hybrid work model.  The photos below show some elements of  the physical space that we have implemented  in Infosys.

Page Number: 10
 We created this paper based on a detailed study covering  1,50,000 Infosys employees, over 2,500 projects across  geographies, 25,000 project documents and 20,000 work-tickets  during the early stages of the pandemic.

Page Number: 10
 We have been using all these insights to design a novel  framework to help our clients arrive at their Return to Office  blueprints, based on the unique characteristics of their  workplace, nature of work and workforce.

Page Number: 10
 Our hybrid model leverages strong policies and processes  working across the workforce (employee) life cycle from hiring,  onboarding, career-building, leadership development through  wellbeing and experience.

 Climate scientists have been warning us about  the deepening climate change crisis for many  decades now. However, corporate climate  action was nascent a decade ago (2008) when  Infosys started its climate action journey. Today,  the world is reaching a panic mode on climate  change. The COP 26 in Glasgow witnessed  climate anxiety. Climate change is causing the  loss of lives and property as well as hampering  or slowing down economic growth.

Page Number: 13
 Climate impacts are expected to deepen unless we keep global  warming to well below 2° C. The Paris Agreement and the global  Net Zero movement are aiming for just that. Many nations  and global corporations have pledged to be net-zero in the  2030-2070 time frame.

 Energy efficiency

Page Number: 15
 Our buildings are the major source of our energy consumption.  We are committed to building our new infrastructure in a  sustainable manner and pursuing energy efficiency projects in  existing infrastructure. We will continue to implement innovative  technologies in buildings and collaborate with experts and  academia to ensure our infrastructure is greener and smarter.  The focus areas for energy efficiency measures in green buildings  and existing buildings continue to be lighting, air-conditioning,  automation, UPS, building façade, data centers,   and server rooms.

Page Number: 15
 In fiscal 2022 we consumed 172.4 million kWh of power in our  operations across the globe, about a 2% decrease from fiscal  2021 as we have kept a keen focus on energy efficiency efforts  focusing on optimization of our operations and processes,  leveraging the use of higher efficiency equipment, and  eliminating energy wastage. We have also been able to reduce  our energy intensity (MWh/US$ million revenue) from 13.0 to  10.57 in the reporting year. Energy efficiency and retrofits

Page Number: 15
 The efficient design of new buildings, deep green retrofits in  existing buildings, green data centers, our super-saver heat  pumps, and operational excellence through smart automation  were crucial in achieving energy efficiency.

Page Number: 15
 Over 15 mn sq. ft. of office buildings have been retrofitted under  fresh air retrofit program

Page Number: 15
 Healthy and efficient workspaces

Page Number: 15
 Fresh air retrofit program was implemented across Infosys  to enhance the amount of fresh air in air-conditioning  systems in office buildings, thereby improving the air  quality and providing a healthy space for employees. This  in turn reduces the spread of infections in general. The  World Health Organization’s (WHO) roadmap to improve  and ensure good ventilation in the context of COVID-19  was the reference for this retrofit program. During this  retrofit exercise, automation was also taken up to monitor  key parameters on air quality in offices, and to make sure  the building systems like air conditioning and lighting  were perfectly synchronized with the requirement,  thereby saving significant energy. Over 15 million sq. ft. of  office buildings have been retrofitted under this program.

 Concern

Page Number: 17
 Globally, data centers account for about 3% of the total  energy use (equivalent to about 200 million tons of carbon  emissions), which is expected to grow by over 30% every year.  Given that data centers are notorious for their energy intensity,  it is important for us as a company striving towards energy  sustainability to invest in greener data centers. We challenged  the global average Power Utilization Effectiveness (PUE) of 1.8  and set an ambitious target to achieve a PUE of less than 1.12,  which is 40% lower than the global PUE.

Page Number: 17
 Approach

Page Number: 17
 Data centers have been key to powering our shared digital  IT infrastructure core, helping businesses, our employees,  partners and clients to connect, collaborate and accelerate  business-led innovations and digital business initiatives across  the world. With the advent of cloud and microservice-led

 Renewable energy

Page Number: 17
 Infosys is the first Indian company to join the RE100.   We have 60 MW of total installed solar capacity. In fiscal 2022  the contribution of renewable energy in our Indian facilities  operations was 53.8%, including electricity generated from  our solar PV plants and green power procurement. We are  continuously working with governments in various states in  India to facilitate the creation of favorable policies to increase the  share of renewables in our energy mix.

Page Number: 17
 53% of the energy requirements of our data centers were   met through renewable sources.

Page Number: 17
 53.8% of electricity for our India operations are  from renewables

Page Number: 17
 design approaches, enterprise data centers are moving to be  the edge of the cloud and distributed architecture patterns of  hybrid clouds are evolving to the next level. Sustainability is an  inextricable part of how we design and operate our data center  facilities and IT services. An enterprise strategic initiative has  been undertaken to modernize the data centers helping us drive  sustainable Total Cost of Ownership TCO reductions, increasing  server density per rack by 12x and establishing a future-ready  clean and green data center managed at scale. Over the last 12  months, through high-density virtualization and consolidation  efforts, 70+ racks are released in the data centers. Data centers  at Infosys campuses account for about 10% of the total power  consumption of our global operations annually. Over the years,  we have implemented several measures to improve efficiency in  our data centers.

Page Number: 17
 New data centers are designed in a very efficient manner,  including chilled water In Row Cooling system with hot aisle /  cold aisle containment, efficient air conditioning strategies  and lighting, and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) systems.  Use of passive cooling technologies are adopted in favorable  weather conditions. Existing data centers are being retrofitted  by rearrangement and consolidation of server racks, replacing  old airconditioning, lighting systems and UPS systems with  new efficient ones along with smart PDU to provide converged  DCIM view. Implementing a Building management system with  capability to remotely monitor key operational parameters  like rack level temperature and real time PUE (Power Usage  Effectiveness) has helped in ensuring reliability and efficiency of  our data centers.

Page Number: 17
 Outcome

Page Number: 17
 The PUE of our data centers across India locations ranges from  1.35 to 2.76, with a weighted average PUE of 1.67

 Accounting for Work from Home emissions  amidst the COVID-19 pandemic

Page Number: 18
 Due to the COVID outbreak in fiscal 2021, we saw a major  shift in our working model. The hybrid working resulted  in increased usage of power at employee homes. Infosys  realized that the employees working from home could  result in potential emissions outside of Infosys boundaries  and control. Thus, starting fiscal 2021, emissions due to  Work from Home (WFH) are being captured and reported.

 Offset program

Page Number: 18
 Emission offsetting is quite universal. Many corporates, events,  and even individuals make use of emission offsets. However,  most of the offset is bought off the shelf. Infosys’ program  has carefully selected grass-root social development projects,  invested in them, and run them to generate emission offsets.  While this approach requires careful long-term planning,  intense due diligence, and strict management control, it is  significantly more rewarding in every aspect. Through this clear  implementation strategy, Infosys showcased to the world that  these low-cost projects could ensure effective and valuable  interventions for the poor. Infosys while actively engaging and  sharing best practices with NGOs, Corporates, and Government  agencies, has also established for them that these projects  could be replicated by any organization. Since 2016, we have  implemented seven efficient cookstove projects, three biogas  project, one rural electrification projects and one integrated  community based project (Solar, Cook stove, Street lighting and  Public Health Center) across India. Such initiatives have led us to  offset our direct and indirect carbon footprint.

 Known for its serene landscapes,  Meghalaya has enchanted tourists  from across the world. Behind the  enigmatic natural beauty lies a few  hard realities about its economic  status and quality of life. According  to NITI Aayog, about 33% of the  population are multi-dimensionally  poor and almost 77% are deprived  of clean cooking fuel. Meghalaya  has one of the highest infant  mortality rates (3.1%) in the country  and almost 32% of the population  does not have access to quality  maternal healthcare.

Page Number: 19
 Situated in Western Meghalaya, the Garo Hills  are inhabited largely by tribal dwellers who use  firewood as the primary cooking fuel. LPG usage  hasn’t caught up due to myriad reasons including  costs, long wait time, lack of distribution centers,  and certain pre-conceived safety notions among  the communities. Finding drywood in Garo, one  of the wettest places in India (annual rainfall over  4,500 mm), is another huge challenge, especially  for the women and girl children who are usually  tasked with the responsibility. They need to  stockpile their firewood requirement for the whole  year during summer. To make matters worse,  indoor air pollution due to burning firewood  leads to severe health disorders like respiratory  problems, cancer, pneumonia, heart disease,  and stroke.

 Infosys partnered with the Global Himalayan  Expedition (GHE) to make a difference to  the lives of 10,000 households by providing  improved high-efficiency biomass cookstoves.  In addition to reducing firewood consumption  and cutting cooking time by about 65%, it  would relieve the households of toxic smoke,  soot, and associated illness. The women would  be able to spend more time in socioeconomic  activities while the girl children would not have  to miss school. The project will also help avoid  tens and thousands of tons of greenhouse  gases from entering the atmosphere and  provide direct employment to around  100 locals.

Page Number: 19
 Under this project, Infosys will install  113 solar streetlights, and rooftop solar for  464 households and four public health centers  (PHCs). Further, the PHCs will also be provided  critical medical equipment. Infosys believes that  electrification of PHCs and supply of medical  equipment will help decrease the mortality  rate. Its carbon offsets projects thus maintain  a fine balance between social development  and environment conservation and create  a long-lasting impact on the lives of the  underprivileged.

 The Udaipur district, in southern Rajasthan, is a  semi-arid climatic region. It receives an average  annual rainfall of about 630 mm, mainly during  monsoon. About 70% the district’s landmass is  forests, pastures, and revenue wastelands, known  as common lands, which have degraded over  the past few decades and affected the life and  livelihoods of local communities. The women and  girls in these regions are not allowed to travel  beyond their villages or at best their panchayats.  While schools are there in the vicinity, institutions  of higher education are not. Thus, girls at best  study till the 12th standard. Most of them drop most  drop out early to help their mothers take care of  household chores.

Page Number: 20
 A majority of the rural communities depend  primarily on firewood to meet their domestic  cooking and heating needs. Each family consumes,  on average, 3 to 4 tons of biomass every year, in  which wood is a key constituent. The women are  usually tasked with the responsibility of collecting  wood from the common lands or private pastures  or own fields. Deforestation has made wood  collection increasingly harder and time consuming.  In some villages, families have started purchasing  wood. Most families use traditional cookstoves,  either three-stone fires or stoves built of mud  / clay / cement without a chimney and grate.  The thermal efficiency of these stoves is as low as  10%, and hence burning of fuel leads to higher  emissions of GHG and particulate matter, which are  harmful to health.

Page Number: 20
 Infosys extended its partnership with Udaipur  Urja Initiatives (UUI) Producer Company Limited,  a social enterprise formed by Seva Mandir, to  uplift women in 7 zones across the 4 blocks of  Kotra, Jhadol, Gogunda, and Girwa. To address  the issue in a sustainable way, Infosys extended  its support to 15,000 families, with improved  cookstoves (ICS) and a fully funded end-to-end

Page Number: 20
 carbon offset initiative. After the success of the  Infosys’ UUIL ICS 1.0 and ICS 2.0, the UUIL team  did an extensive demonstration and pilot with  users in the newly selected blocks to create  awareness and acceptance of the technology.  The Greenway Grameen manufactured ICS  helps avoid 2.0-2.5 tCO2e per family, every year.

Page Number: 20
 The ICS is a single burner, high-efficiency  cookstove based on the patent-pending  air-flow technology. The stove can use any  type of solid biomass fuel and produces about  70% less smoke and uses 65% less fuel than  the traditional ones made of mud. The lifespan  of the stoves is estimated to be 5 years.  Each project family will receive two stoves  – one of each model (Greenway Smart and  Greenway Jumbo).

Page Number: 20
 The UUIL has set up a team of   7 center coordinators who will cater to   20-25 villages, 15-20 monitors (100% women),  2,000-2,500 households, in an average radius  of 20 km. Infosys will provide the field monitors  a smartphone loaded with an app to collect  beneficiary information, stove distribution  details, continuous monitoring, and verification  on the usage of ICS every month for the entire  5 years. With this women and school-going  children will get the experience of a digital  way of sharing messages, learning new skills,  attending online classes, etc. In addition,  women in the project area can engage in  new income-generating opportunities, like  tailoring, sericulture, and running small shops,  besides getting employed in Infosys projects  as supervisors and monitors. Most importantly,  women now have more time to spend with  family and children and the girl children are  also now free from the backbreaking task of  firewood collection and no longer need to miss  their school.

 Robots for cleaning and coating overhead  conductors

Page Number: 23
 Today, the US has an installed conductor base of 400K miles and  the power losses amount to US$ 25 billion. Utilities are facing  a problem of aging infrastructure and significant transmission  power losses. 25% of the installed conductor base requires  replacement in another 10 years. In addition, the transmission  power lines tend to heat up due to power transmission and  exposure to solar heating. This causes the conductors to sag and  may cause forest fires due to vegetation intrusions. The Infosys’  Advanced Engineering Group partnered with Prysmian Group  to develop innovative autonomous robots that clean and coat  the overhead conductors live with client proprietary coating  material and thereby enhance the current carrying capacity by  25%, reduce the power loss and conductor sag by 25%. We won  the prestigious Edison Gold Innovation Award in fiscal 2022 for  this project.

 Solar panel cleaning robot

Page Number: 23
 Solar installations struggle to maintain the panels free from dirt  and dust. It has been shown that efficiency of solar PV panels is  reduced by as much as 25% due to dirt and other materials that  reduce the light transfer. Manual cleaning methods are water  intensive, and require high manpower. Operating over 60MW  of captive solar capacity, Infosys addressed this challenge by  developing state-of-the-art robots to assess and clean the panels  automatically. Infosys’ system analyzes each panel for cleanliness,  and uses AI to determine the proper cleaning method -- wet  or dry, as well as the specific areas to clean. The system is fast  and efficient, ensures minimal water usage, maintains optimal  panel performance, and reduces labor required in often hot  environments that pose risks of injury.

 Planning for Nationwide Sustainability

Page Number: 23
 When a Nordic country sought to understand how it could  promote sustainability among its local corporations, and develop  an environment that would attract businesses and people  from around the world to come, stay, live, and thrive. The client  organization requested research that would indicate what  external groups, business, research hubs, or experts would be  the go-to sources for the latest thinking in Sustainability. The  Infosys Sustainability Practice, however, went much further.  We determined through our research that we also needed  to establish a baseline understanding of the key factors of  sustainability, how they might be prioritized, and how they  impact the client’s goals of promoting and attracting business  activity. The extensive report that resulted included a broad and  deep analysis of current activities, recommendations as to how  priorities might be adjusted, and a thorough analysis of external  experts, sources and partners that could assist in the client’s  Sustainability journey.

 Towards a positive water  footprint

Page Number: 26
 Water being a scarce and invaluable natural  resource, we are strongly committed to its  conservation through the 3R (Reduce, Reuse,  Recycle) approach. We are a signatory to the  CEO Water Mandate, and will continue to  strengthen our water stewardship practices  in our operations and extend our efforts to  the community.

Page Number: 26
 

Page Number: 26
 Our approach

Page Number: 26
 According to World Resources Institute (WRI), as many as  3.5 billion people could experience water scarcity by 2025, while  demand is projected to grow by up to 30% by 2050. At Infosys  we are committed to reducing our water footprint and  enhancing water availability in the communities where  we operate.

 Rainwater harvesting

Page Number: 26
 An important element of our water management system is  rainwater harvesting (RWH). We recharge and replenish our  groundwater system with the help of natural and artificial lakes  / ponds, rooftop rainwater harvesting systems, and deep-well  injection systems. We have established around 400 deep  injection wells across India campuses, providing a combined  recharge capacity of around 20 million liters. Our efforts on  rainwater harvesting have enabled us to raise the groundwater  levels benefiting the communities residing in the areas  surrounding our campuses. We have also built 35 lakes across  our campuses, holding 330 million liters of rainwater storage  capacity. These lakes offer a thriving ecosystem for diverse  species of fauna and aquatic vegetation, contributing to building  greater biodiversity.

Page Number: 26
 During the year we undertook Rooftop Rainwater Harvesting  Projects across some of our India campuses as below:

Page Number: 26
 • Thiruvananthapuram: covering 6,718 sq.m. of roof area

Page Number: 26
 • Chandigarh: covering 6,000 sq.m. of roof area

Page Number: 26
 • Bengaluru: connecting the roof rainwater runoff to 5,000 kl  capacity UGR. The project covers 5,000 sq.m. of roof area

Page Number: 26
 We also enabled the utilization of rainwater / lake water to   reduce dependency on other sources. Some of our projects in  this space include:

Page Number: 26
 1.   Hyderabad SEZ: Increased Lake water utilization in  irrigation 5-fold from 9,150 kl in fiscal 2020 to 55,356 kl in  fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2022 lake water utilization improved  10% to 60,854 kl. This helped reduce the dependency on  water through external tankers. Lakes are recharged with  roof rainwater from nearby buildings.

Page Number: 26
 2.   Chennai M City: In fiscal 2022 roof RWH supply was  41,778 kl or 49% of total freshwater supply.

Page Number: 26
 3.   Thiruvananthapuram DC: In fiscal 2022 lake water supply  was 10,382 kl or 60% of total freshwater supply (utilized for  flushing and HVAC requirement). 400 deep injection wells across India campuses with a recharge  capacity of around 20 million liters 35 lakes across our campuses, holding 330 million liters of  rainwater storage capacity

 Leveraging technology

Page Number: 27
 We have leveraged technology to monitor and control our water  consumption. Our smart metering solution monitored through  our central monitoring system, led us to monitor water flow,  consumption patterns in real-time allowing for early diagnosis  and optimization through the identification of problems  like leakages at our facilities. We have also implemented  retrofits in our plumbing systems like pressure compensating  aerators (PCA), waterless urinals and sensor-based taps in high  utilization areas which have enabled us to achieve our water  conservation goals

Page Number: 27
 Water-wise through recycling

Page Number: 27
 One of our water sustainability plans is ensuring treatment of  sewage water generated and repurposing the same to reduce  freshwater requirement to that extent. We have implemented  state-of-the-art membrane bio reactor (MBR) sewage treatment  plants across many of our India campuses which are capable of  tertiary treatment. We ensure that the wastewater we generate  is treated in-house in the sewage treatment plants (STPs) that  we operate at our large campuses and leased campuses in India.  In few of our smaller leased offices, with limited space or lesser  operational control, the wastewater is discharged into municipal  sewers and undergoes further treatment. We ensure that we  treat and reuse 100% of the wastewater generated through our  business operations within our campuses. Consequently, our  freshwater withdrawal has reduced drastically as we reuse the  recycled water for all our gardening, landscaping, flushing, and  cooling needs.

Page Number: 27
 In fiscal 2022, we recycled and reused up to 705445.25 kl of  water, which amounts to 64.77% of the total water withdrawal.

 Our waste management approach is based on  the philosophy of Reduce, Reuse and Recycle.  We seek to uphold our ambition of zero waste in  landfills through active minimization combined  with technology investment in recycling and  streamlining systems and processes. With our  efforts, we contribute to a circular economy and  convert waste into resources.

Page Number: 28
 Our waste management approach

Page Number: 28
 We have established robust waste management practices,  including segregation of waste at source, secondary segregation,  efficient collection and handling, recycling, and effective disposal  of all wastes in adherence to applicable legislations. This enables  reduction of environmental impacts. We also insist on   eco-friendly packaging for all our purchases.

Page Number: 28
 In-house treatment practices

Page Number: 28
 The food waste generated on campuses are processed in  high-rate bioreactors where the organic loading rate is  significantly higher even when its loaded close to its rated  capacity. Bi-phasic bio-digestion is known for its effectiveness  and was tested at one of the Infosys sites. This helped address  challenges like inconsistent input feed rate as well as the quality  of wet waste. Based on the successful results of the trial the  process was implemented across various other biogas plants  in India which has enabled process stabilization. The efficiency  of the biogas plant is enhanced through automation, with the  generated biogas offsetting the LPG usage in our food courts  and helping avoid methane emissions from the waste. Organic  waste converters and shredders are also installed in some of our  campuses in India for the treatment of garden waste. We use the  resultant manure for our campus landscapes.

Page Number: 28
 Another category of waste generated includes the semi-solid  sludge from our STPs. This wet sludge contains semi-digested  organic matter and a lot of moisture and pathogens making  it unsuitable for direct soil application. At a few campuses in  India, we implemented solar sludge drying beds, that ensure the  sludge can now be used as manure.

Page Number: 28
 We are constantly improving our Waste management practices  and working towards our 2030 goal of “Zero Waste to Landfill”.  One challenge was walking that last mile to ensure that our  mixed garbage which has no economic value gets processed and  responsibly recycled. We are working with identified vendors  across locations to enable this, thus diverting our waste from  landfills and contributing to a circular economy. Waste is picked  up by them for further segregation, aggregation and then finally  sent either for recycling or co-processing. In the year 2021-22, we  have diverted around 122.65T from landfill which is around 78%  of the total mixed waste generated across campuses in India.

 Dealing with e-waste

Page Number: 28
 Infosys is committed to safe, and environment friendly disposal  of items declared as e-waste (waste from electrical and electronic  equipment WEEE) in compliance with applicable legislations. We  are committed to share best practices and work towards higher  efficiency in e-waste management for the benefit of the entire  environment. We believe in leaving for our future generations a  sound and healthy natural environment.

Page Number: 28
 Being a technology company e-waste is generated periodically  due to technological obsolescence. Once equipment / gadgets  / consumables like toners are identified as e-waste, they are  segregated and stored in identified areas. E-waste recyclers who  comply with applicable legislations and other requirements  as defined by Infosys are evaluated through site assessments  for disposal of e-waste for recycling. Recycling certificates are  obtained from the recyclers. Some of the waste may be sent on  a buy back to original equipment manufacturers. An awareness  session on e-waste with a specific focus on domestic e-waste was  organized with over 200 participants.

 Environmental compliance

Page Number: 29
 We have a strong environmental management system aligned  with ISO 14001:2015, and covers 80% of our India locations.  At the remaining locations as well as our overseas locations,  we have implemented processes based on legal requirements /  internal benchmarks and have also included them in the internal  audits cycle. We are in compliance with the applicable legal  requirements across our locations. We conduct environmental  impact assessments for all our routine and non-routine activities  and the significant concerns creating an environmental impact  includes depletion of resources like power and water; waste  generation and disposal and emissions that are part of our  material aspects. Environmental impacts of new services,  activities and changes in process or legislations are also  conducted. We conduct environmental impact assessment  studies for all new projects, wherever applicable, covering  impacts related to air, water, social aspects, and biodiversity,  among others.

Page Number: 29
 No cases of monetary or non-monetary sanctions for violations or  environmental grievances have been reported in the fiscal year  2022. Our campus is built on state-approved land in an industrial  area and is not adjacent to protected areas or biodiversity  areas. A process for monitoring requirements in line with legal  requirements is established and we ensure that all parameters are  always maintained well within the defined norms.

Page Number: 29
 BMS integration of biogas plants

Page Number: 29
 With a view to enhance performance of the biogas plants across  locations through monitoring, an initiative to integrate the plants  into our Building Management Systems (BMS) was undertaken.  The integration was undertaken at Bengaluru, Mangalore,  Thiruvananthapuram and Hyderabad SEZ locations during the  year, and we are now able to monitor the operation of integrated  biogas plants in real time including:

Page Number: 29
 –  Operational status and alarms of various parts of the biogas  plants such as digestors, pumps, heaters and shredders

Page Number: 29
 –  Critical operational parameters like temperature, pH, pressure  of digestors and pressure vessel capacity filled

Page Number: 29
 –  BMS will also collect waste input, gas production, gas  utilization and gas flared values for each location and calculate  the gas production rate, treatment efficiency, LPG equivalents,  GHG avoidance (kgs of CO2) and efficiency of GHG avoidance.  These parameters calculated, aggregated for various periods  of time, and represented in dashboards for each location. BMS  also enables us to configure and generate daily, monthly, and  yearly reports for these parameters providing a PAN India  overview of wet waste processing through bio-methanation.

 January 2020 was life-altering for everyone. Over the course  of the next few months, COVID-19 cases began to surge across  the globe and finally on March 11, 2020, the World Health  Organization (WHO) declared the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)   a global pandemic.

Page Number: 34
 The Government of Karnataka struggled to track infected  patients, their treatment and recovery during the COVID-19  surge. To offer a holistic solution to the problem, we collaborated  with the state government and a consortium of partners to build  Apthamitra - a platform for the containment of COVID-19 and  BBMP Bed Management System.

 Apthamitra

 Apthamitra brings different stakeholders like government  officials, citizens, NGOs, volunteers, nurses, Arogyamitra  volunteers, among others together on to a single platform  to monitor, track and respond to the COVID-19 situation in  Karnataka. The platform aims to maximize the utilization of  resources and contain the outbreak.

 Apthamitra’s remote care module maximized resource utilization  across hospitals and medical facilities through immediate  help and response to citizens. Patients who needed more than  just medical advice based on symptoms are assigned to a  telemedicine doctor.

Page Number: 34
 During the pandemic, we realized that beyond medical help,  citizens were also in dire need of food, clothing, groceries and  other necessities. NGOs like Karnataka’s Asha workers along with  other volunteers stepped forward to collaborate with various

 Pathfinders Online Institute

 One of the primary ways the Foundation achieves its impact  is through the Pathfinders Institute, a historically in-person  professional development program that went virtual due to  COVID-19. This past year, 700 teachers took part in this initiative,  reaching approximately 21,000 students. The Foundation also  engaged in over 20 partnerships with leading organizations that  bring dynamic digital skills to Latinx, Black, Native American,  and neurodiverse micro-communities in all 50 states, reaching  thousands of students and educators. Additionally, the Foundation  dramatically increased the offerings of the Pathfinders Online  Institute, the digital learning platform launched in 2019 that  currently offers over 52 courses for the year-round K-12 ecosystem.  This year, over 12,600 new accounts were created, reaching  approximately 400k + students. Additionally, through the platform  the Foundation gave away over 6,000 computer science kits and  free instructional resources to educators seeking to make their  instructional lessons come to life. Through the Infy Maker Awards,  the Foundation granted 10 organizations a grant of US$10k  each to support the advancement of maker-centered learning in  traditional schools, museums, libraries, and other youth-serving  organizations. This program has now given over US$1 million to 95  organizations across the country since it was launched 7 years ago.

 Risk assessment

Page Number: 45
 Risk assessment is proactively conducted to identify hazards  for all existing / new / modified activities, process, products  or services and the implementation of measures to minimize  or control impacts, and monitor them in a structured manner.  Risk assessment is proactively conducted on a yearly basis  or at the beginning of a new process or activity. Reactive risk  assessments are also carried out at least once every quarter  based on incidents that have occurred during the period.  Hazardous conditions present are identified and prioritized for  elimination and control. Once the identified hierarchy of controls  are implemented, the document is revisited to assess the residual  risks. A ranking is done based on the severity and probability of

Page Number: 45
 the risk. The OH&S hazards in the workplace are communicated  to all concerned stakeholders who are also consulted when there  are changes in operations. Relevant OH&S hazards are identified,  and appropriate operational controls are implemented. During  training, the hazards are shared along with directions on  ways to reduce the risk. Employees are also consulted during  development and review of policies and procedures to manage  risks.

Page Number: 45
 As Infosys is an IT / ITES company, there are no product risks but  those related to provision of services like ergonomics, emotional  wellbeing, risks associated with operation of utilities, commute,  etc., We have established numerous initiatives, interventions,  virtual sessions, and process controls to address them.  Well-equipped occupational health centers / physiotherapy  facilities are available at our campuses in India. During the  year the doctors and physios have helped employees and their  dependents consult virtually through the telemedicine portal.  Various interventions on physical and emotional wellbeing were  enabled under the aegis of our HALE initiative.

 Incident management

Page Number: 45
 Incidents which include near misses / potential hazards /  accidents are reported through internal applications, supervisors  or mails. Root causes of incidents are identified, analyzed and  appropriate corrective actions are taken to avoid recurrence or  occurrence of incidents leading to injuries / losses.

 Occupational Health & Safety (OH&S) committees

Page Number: 45
 Occupational Health & Safety (OH&S) committees are  established at each of our campuses and offices comprising of  cross-functional teams. The Development Center Head chair  safety committee meetings at their respective locations in India.  In our overseas offices these committees are formed based on  the local legislations. The representation of employees in safety  committees is 100%.

 Resolution hubs

Page Number: 47
 A safe and positive work environment is what we want to be  associated with and in keeping with this philosophy, we envisage  an open-door policy. Employees can access several forums where  they can highlight matters or concerns faced at the workplace.  This is achieved through a well-established and robust  grievance resolution mechanism comprising ‘resolution hubs’.  The Anti-Sexual Harassment Initiative (ASHI) and the Hearing  Employees and Resolving (HEAR) networks are designated  as redressal forums for sexual harassment and workplace- related complaints, respectively. Resolution hubs adhere to the  principles of natural justice, confidentiality, sensitivity, non- retaliation and fairness while addressing concerns. The concerns  are handled with sensitivity and are redressed and closed in a  timebound manner.

Page Number: 47
 A detailed investigation process ensures fairness for all involved,  with an opportunity to present facts and any material evidence.

 Human rights

Page Number: 47
 Infosys is a signatory to the UNGC. Our human rights stand is  contained in our Code of Conduct & Ethics in an important tenet,  ‘Respecting Each Other.’  The Infosys Human Rights Statement  articulates our philosophy to provide a discrimination-free  workplace for all employees and contractors.  All our employees

Page Number: 47
 and contractors undergo a mandatory Smart Awareness  Quiz (SAQ), every year, which includes questions on human  rights and the Infosys Code of Conduct & Ethics. The SAQ is a  comprehensive tool which also includes ‘self-study’ tutorials,  allowing employees to learn and then take up the assessments.

Page Number: 47
 In fiscal 2022, we undertook an independent Human Rights  Impact Assessment of our operations across India. India  comprises >80% of our employee base. The assessment protocol  was created based on the Articles contained in the Universal  Nations Directive on Human Rights (UNDHR), ILO, UNGC  Principles, the GRI Standards, the Business Responsibility and  Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) parameters, as well as Health  & Safety criteria and environment management systems. It is  our constant endeavor to make Infosys a place where people  can be the best version of themselves. The Talent Pulse Report  2021, provides a glimpse into our Employee wellness and  experience practices.

Page Number: 47
 Employee wellness and experience is an important ambition  as a part of Infosys’ ESG Vision 2030. As a part of our continued  efforts, we created and deployed a Hybrid work model (read  page 9 and 10 of the ESG Report 2021-22). The model focuses  on the three dimensions of Work, Workplace and Workforce.  It helps the enterprise in defining the best fit working model  for the long term that also meets the requirements of business  and the expectations of employees. The suggestions from the  independent human rights impact assessment allowed us to  accelerate our part time and remote work policies and inform our  hybrid model further.

Page Number: 47
 All our security personnel are trained on human rights related  topics. The SCoC has reference to human rights and it states,  ‘Infosys expects its suppliers to support and respect the  protection of internationally proclaimed human rights and  to ensure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses.’  As part of the onboarding process the vendors have to accept  the SCoC. The procurement team ensures that SCoC acceptance  is done by vendors and maintains a tracker for the same. Human  Rights Impacts are also evaluated through an independent  responsible supplier assessment for our top 100 suppliers that  was initiated in fiscal 2022.

 Employee satisfaction

Page Number: 47
 Infosys has robust mechanisms to gauge employee sentiments  and feedback. Up until fiscal 2020, employee engagement at  Infosys was measured through an annual survey – LITMUS.  When the pandemic the team quickly reimagined this tool  for the new remote work of work and introduced an ongoing  sensing process called Pulse.

Page Number: 47
 Pulse is our enhanced tool for collecting ongoing and real-time  feedback from employees anonymously on key organization  wide themes that we believe shape an employee’s experience  at Infosys such as work, learning, careers etc. We poll the entire  organization through a micro survey on an ongoing monthly  basis every quarter to get a sense of employees’ sentiments  on the ground. In addition to this ongoing monthly survey, we  also poll our employees on select tenure-based milestones and  specific events including onboarding, job rotation, appraisals,  amongst many others. This cumulative understanding of  employee perception, and feedback from actual events and  milestones has strengthened our sensing architecture to obtain  richer insights of employee experiences.

Page Number: 47
 To drive change across the organization, all managers have  access to a real-time customized dashboard consisting of  feedback from their respective teams which enable them to  engage their teams better and address any concerns. This  dashboard has multiple views and advanced analytics such  as heatmaps, trendlines, sentiment analytics to enable the  managers to prioritize focus areas according to their teams.  Managers along with their respective units HRs and leadership  work on making changes or improvements at the Unit / team  level on the ground. Over 50,000 employees participated  in Q4 with insights gathered around various themes of the  organization. These insights have led us to create focus areas  for actionizing on a quarterly basis which is socialized with  the leadership team and progress on the same is updated  periodically.

 Performance management

Page Number: 48
 Our performance management process is designed to cater to  the needs of each individual employee. We focus on identifying  the best performers against standards of performance instead  of relative comparison of individuals. This mechanism helps us  to identify our best performers through well-defined goals that  are always relevant, continuous feedback and a strong focus on  employee development. Our process helps us to keep the focus  on “performance and development” conversations between  the manager and team members wherein the employee’s  future development is given as much importance as the past  performance. Aligning with this performance management  philosophy, we have the defined performance review and  assessment process for managers and their teams and for leaders  and sales. For managers and teams, the performance assessment  cycle is annual whereas for leaders and sales it is bi-annual.

Page Number: 48
 All of our employees are enabled to carry goals aligned to their  respective roles and business scenarios. Leaders get evaluated  on their performance bi-annually and other employees on an  annual basis. Continuous feedback is an important element  of the process with regular reviews, culminating into a rating  based holistic view of the employee’s performance. Performance  conversations between employee and manager happens on an  ongoing basis, given the continuous performance process that  we have in Infosys.

Page Number: 48
 The continuous feedback process helps managers provide  instant feedback for necessary improvements in the work that is  being done. In case of continued lack of expected performance,  employees are identified for a structured performance  improvement plan where they are given goals and the managers  support them in achieving those goals. Employees are also  encouraged to take up trainings to upskill / reskill themselves to

Page Number: 48
 meet the needs of the projects. At the end of the performance  cycle employees receive a performance rating on their  performance.

Page Number: 48
 To support the process, we have our web and mobile app  called iCount, where employees can add their goals and are  encouraged to update progress against those on a regular basis.  Managers can provide feedback to employees on these goals  and support them in achieving the objectives. Managers set  up development goals for employees which help them grow  in their career. Feedback from client stakeholder (although not  mandated by the process) is also a key input that the manager  uses during performance and development conversations.  Along with this, employees can seek and share feedback with all  the colleagues they work with. Thus, iCount goes a long way to  provide the holistic view of the employees’ performance.

 As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC),  Infosys leverages the UNGC principles covering human rights,  labor, environment, and anti-corruption as foundational  principles for building and improving its sustainable supply chain  practices. The Company is committed to providing opportunities  to diverse businesses and integrating the UNGC principles into  our supply chain and towards building a positive long-term  environmental and social impact.

 Supplier assessments

Page Number: 55
 In fiscal 2022 we launched a responsible supply chain  assessment through an external, independent consulting  partner. This assessment will cover our top 100 suppliers over  the next four-five years. Our effort seeks to baseline their ESG  performance and identify areas we could collaborate to improve  performance. The assessments cover governance, ethics and  compliance with law, fair business practices, labor practices  and human rights, health and safety, and environment. The  assessment is based on a protocol which leverages the Infosys  Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC), ISO 26000, GRI, UNHRC, Ethical  Trading Initiative (ETI) and other international frameworks.

Page Number: 55
 The Infosys Supplier Code of Conduct leverages the UNGC  principles including protecting and upholding internationally  proclaimed human rights, endorsing treating all persons  with respect and dignity while safeguarding their rights, the  elimination of forced and compulsory labor, the abolition  of child labor in the supply chain and strong corporate  governance practices including anti-corruption and bribery and  promoting Fair Business Practices across the supply chain. As  an environmentally-conscious organization, Infosys also urges  suppliers to protect the environment and make abstemious  use of scarce natural resources in their business processes and  simultaneously emphasizing the importance of health and safety  in its workplace and expects the supplier to comply with such  health and safety requirements and industry good practices  in letter and spirit. Infosys expects its suppliers to support and  respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human  rights and to ensure that they are not complicit in human rights

 abuses.’ As part of the onboarding process the vendors have  to accept the SCoC. The procurement team ensures that SCoC  acceptance is done by vendors and maintains a tracker for the  same. In fiscal 2022, 25% of our top 100 suppliers were trained on  ESG topics and their relevance to products and services provided  to Infosys. The sessions laid a strong foundation for expectations  from our suppliers on their ESG performance.

 Prudent barrier to entry

Page Number: 55
 As part of the pre-contract and evaluation stage, we perform  exhaustive due diligence of suppliers in the areas of sanctions,  corruption, financial crimes, litigations and ESG issues at the time  of on-boarding and periodically thereafter, with the help of a  third-party tool. This assessment covers compliance, information  security, physical security and sustainability, based on the type  of vendor. Risk-based audits of selected suppliers are conducted,  and we take stringent action against non-compliance. All our  new suppliers were screened using social and environmental  criteria during empanelment.

 Local suppliers

Page Number: 55
 Our centralized procurements are in India, but we engage with  local suppliers on local needs across geographies. The proportion  of spending on local suppliers (in India) was nearly 72% in   fiscal 2022. We did not have any significant actual and potential  negative environmental and social impacts in the supply chain.  We did not have any significant changes to our supply chain in  fiscal 2022.

 Integrity and compliance

Page Number: 56
 The Ethics and Compliance Program at Infosys has two key  objectives – to uphold and ensure the values of Integrity  and Transparency and to assure enterprise-wide regulatory  compliance.

Page Number: 56
 Integrity is key to nurturing a responsible business. Beyond  regulation and stakeholder attention, there is a growing  recognition that good behavior is good for business. At Infosys  our commitment to a values-based ethos is enshrined in our  Code of Conduct & Ethics. Our values are the principles we use to  run the Company on a daily basis and are the source of our Code  of Conduct & Ethics. Our values are the foundation of everything  we do and are encapsulated in the acronym C-LIFE.

Page Number: 56
 Code of Conduct & Ethics

Page Number: 56
 We firmly believe that following the highest standards of  business conduct and ethics helps us run our business  responsibly. Our Code of Conduct & Ethics helps us maintain the  highest ethical standards for our employees. It complies with the  legal requirements of applicable laws and regulations, including  anti-bribery - anti-corruption and ethical handling of conflicts of  interest. It also highlights expectations from our employees. Our  business partners acknowledge and comply with the Supplier  Code of Conduct which is based on the UN global compact  principles.

 1.   Code of Conduct & Ethics (Digital Version): In February  this year, Infosys launched a new digitized version of the  Code of Conduct & Ethics. It provides user-friendly access  to specific topics in an interactive manner. It is a unique  audio-visual experience and is easy to navigate. The Code  can be accessed on mobile devices as well. Launching the  digital version of the Code aims to help every employee  understand the behavior we expect and the principles and  values we uphold. We aim to continue to build a culture of  compliance, where everyone feels they are able to do the  right thing and prioritize legal and ethical choices.

 2.   The Ethics and Culture Survey: Employees’ feedback  helps us keep tab on ethical and cultural aspirations of  employees, and to gauge if they feel empowered to act  with integrity and do the right thing. In our continued  efforts of culture building, we rolled out an Ethics and  Culture Survey in August 2021. The Survey was designed  to assess the ethical culture of the organization. Using  the feedback provided, we created a plan to embed the  inputs into the overall ethics and compliance program and  continuously bolster our culture of ethics and compliance.

 Compliance proof testing

Page Number: 57
 • Infosys implemented a compliance program  covering 80 countries and 14 regulatory areas  across major business enabling functions in  September 2018

Page Number: 57
 • The compliance program instituted a  self-assessment of compliance status against a  compliance framework with a maker-checker  process in-built into it.

Page Number: 57
 • The program also enabled the creation of  a repository of compliance proofs against  compliance self-assessment.

Page Number: 57
 • By consolidating compliance proofs across  countries and regulatory areas against a  pre-defined compliance framework, Infosys  designed an OCR-based technology to scan the  proofs and independently validate if the proofs  corroborate compliance status.

Page Number: 57
 • The OCR technology was combined with a rule  engine to test compliance controls around  timeliness and accuracy of compliance proof.

Page Number: 57
 Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI & ML)  for effective compliance monitoring of controls

 The Anti-Bribery & Anti-Corruption (ABAC) policy we follow sets our  position on bribery and corruption in detail, which is reviewed by  the Management at regular intervals.

Page Number: 57
 Anti-competitive practices / policy

Page Number: 57
 The anti-trust / anti-competitive policy states the objective, scope,  applicability and regulatory consequences, which is periodically  reviewed by the Management. This policy includes three legs  of anti-trust law: (i) abuse of dominance; (ii) anti-competitive  practice; (iii) merger control. Besides, a list of do’s and don’ts are  communicated to the relevant stakeholders highlighting expected  behaviors.

Page Number: 57
 Export Control policy

Page Number: 57
 The Export Control policy describes Infosys Export Control program,  and is reviewed periodically by the Management. The Export Control  program protects the company and its employees from potential  risk of violation of sanctions prescribed under export control  regulations and facilitates business expansion in accordance with  these regulations. All our customers and vendors are screened  against various sanctions to assure that we are compliant. As  part of the program, training modules are rolled out to relevant  employees in order to ensure that they are aware and are compliant  with export control laws. We have self-assessment and certification  program in place for anti-bribery and anti-corruption, anti-trust /  anti-competition, and Export Control program.

 Evolving notion of privacy

Page Number: 58
 At Infosys, privacy has always been a primary expectation to  avoid unwanted intrusion into one’sprivate space. But in the  digital world where we live today, the very notion of private  space has undergone drastic changes.

Page Number: 58
 Advancements in computing technologies and innovation  has made it easier to glean our digital footprints from various  sensors, wearables, website cookies, smartphone location  to name a few, often without our knowledge or choice. Rich  insights obtained from these may benefit us but could also  intrude into our decisional autonomy, with the line between  the two increasingly getting blurred. Hence as an organization,  we make the right design choices that strike a balance between  innovation and privacy, with complete transparency, while  engineering solutions.

Page Number: 58
 Approach to sustained data privacy  compliance

Page Number: 58
 At Infosys, we constituted the data privacy function over a  decade ago and it functions as an independent business  enabling function reporting to General Counsel. We complied  with all applicable data privacy regulations in fiscal 2022 in  building applications, platforms, or while executing client  projects, by introducing appropriate privacy safeguards. To  demonstrate our top management’s commitment to privacy,  we have formulated the data privacy policy and published the  same on intranet. In order to ensure complete transparency, we  provide privacy notices at the time of data collection to both  internal and external data subjects and privacy statement is also  made available for external data subjects on public domain.  These are constantly strengthened to reflect the changes in  personal data processing or DP regulations.   Infosys - Privacy Notice.

 Aspirations in data privacy

 Privacy by design EPIC program

Page Number: 59
 Anticipating the need for making privacy an integral part  of application development, an organization-wide strategic  initiative named EPIC (Embedding Privacy by Design into Infosys  Culture) has been rolled out by the Infosys Data Privacy Office  in collaboration with Quality team, to embed privacy by design  into the solution development process at Infosys which enables  and promotes responsible data-centric innovation that complies  with data privacy regulations in a way that meets both end-user  and client expectations, leading to market differentiation.  This program focuses on introducing privacy design strategies,  patterns and guidelines to integrate privacy principles and  requirements into solutions and platforms development  environment. This will also help engineers in making the right  design trade off in order to proactively ensure that privacy is a  positive sum game.

 Keeping in view the large-scale personal data processing  involved, we use tools and technologies to institutionalize data  privacy practices and controls across the enterprise. Over the  years, the growing awareness and education on data privacy  among stakeholders has contributed to a more robust process.  To make our processes compliant to privacy laws and embed  privacy into the design of our systems, Data Privacy Impact  Assessments are conducted for every new process or when there  is a change in the existing process, which involves processing  of PII / SPI.

 Vendor data privacy guidelines

Page Number: 59
 Vendor data privacy management has assumed strategic  significance in data protection and privacy programs, given  increasing dependency on outsourcing including cloud  service providers. Suppliers present difficult and unique  privacy and cybersecurity challenges. Compliance with diverse  Data Protection Laws across the world requires an effective  mechanism for managing supplier related risks to Infosys.  We have published comprehensive guidelines for the suppliers/ vendors to ensure that they adhere to strict obligations imposed  both under contracts and from applicable laws of the land,  during their engagement with Infosys and its subsidiaries.

Page Number: 59
 Robust incident management and breach handling

Page Number: 59
 At Infosys, we have robust mechanisms to detect, assess,  contain and manage data privacy breaches and incidents and  well defined processes and procedures to respond to breach  notification obligations within defined timelines in accordance  with laws of the land. If an incident or a breach is determined to  be of high impact, or if the law of land mandates, such breaches  are notified to the impacted data subjects and / or supervisory  authority. We also incorporate key learnings from incidents by  including similar scenarios in privacy awareness stories and tips  sent to employees.

Page Number: 59
 In fiscal 2022, there were no substantiated complaints received  concerning breaches of customer privacy from outside parties  and regulatory authorities. There was only one breach identified  during the reporting period, outside the organization and where  users were notified of the breach.

 Data subject rights process

Page Number: 59
 Of late, data subject rights have become an intrinsic part of  data privacy laws in many countries. These rights are legally  enforceable, but they are never absolute in nature, which makes  the fulfilment all the more complex. Infosys has established  necessary tools and processes to cater to such data subject rights  requests within the stipulated timelines.

The events span  over several months and reward mechanisms are in place  to promote participation. Additionally, monthly awareness  mailers in the form of privacy tips and stories are also sent  to everyone in the organization to strengthen awareness.  We conducted Privacy Symposium 2021, a maiden virtual  conference organized by the Infosys Data Privacy Office  in association with IAPP, where participants connected  with privacy leaders, CPOs, experts from academia, global  frontline practitioners to reflect on key trends, challenges,  and best practices. Some of the sessions organized as part  of this included privacy engineering, such as anonymization,  privacy preserving synthetic data, AI & data ethics and  human behavior, privacy standards, data subject rights and  other emerging areas. A similar symposium is planned in  2022 in collaboration with international bodies.
