E-waste managementAt Infosys, we have been persistent in our  efforts to ensure that we reduce, reuse, recycle  and dispose e-waste responsibly. Our e-waste  includes computers, desktops, laptops,  keyboards, mobiles, printers, cartridges and  batteries. Generated e-waste is always sent  back to original manufacturers (under buyback  schemes) or authorized recyclers who provide  us certificates on the successful recycling  and recovery of the material. The selection  of authorized recyclers is done keeping in  mind the extent of resource circularity in  their process.

With  innovative features like tax wizard, mobile  application and pre-fill of tax forms, the new  portal makes it easier and more convenient  for taxpayers to file their income tax returns  and access related services.
